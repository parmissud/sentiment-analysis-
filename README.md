# NLP Project with PyTorch and Transformers

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing an sentiment-analysis project using PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers. The notebook focuses on text processing, feature extraction, and model training for natural language tasks.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization and feature extraction.
- **TF-IDF Representation**: Converts raw text into numerical features.
- **Transformer-based Model**: Implements a pre-trained BERT model for NLP tasks.
- **PyTorch Integration**: Uses PyTorch for training and fine-tuning models.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Leverages state-of-the-art NLP models for text analysis.

## Methods Used

- **PyTorch**: Framework for deep learning and NLP model implementation.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Used for loading and fine-tuning pre-trained language models.
- **BERT**: Pre-trained model applied for NLP tasks such as classification or sentiment analysis.
- **TF-IDF**: Term frequency-inverse document frequency for feature extraction.
- **Tokenization**: Converts raw text into numerical representations for model input.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Required Python libraries:
  ```sh
  pip install torch transformers sklearn numpy pandas
  ```

## How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`NLP-project.ipynb`) in Google Colab or a local Jupyter environment.
2. Ensure PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers are installed.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to process text data and train the model.
